 Project description:

You don't need any other directions beyond the basics.
This project will get data from a filled form on the wufoo website and return 
the entire data that was entered in the form. Separate line by line in the
order entered.

Everything is working fine.

Sprint 2 update:
 This is the continuation of the sprint 1
for this sprint I added a database.py, and cubes_records.py files 
to create a new database and update the previous entries in sprint 1.
Also, I updated my continuous Integration/devOps on GitHub in order to run the tests
Added my secret key value in action under the * Secrets and variables in 
gitHub

Here is my Database layout:
my cube database contains 9 fields for user to enter a data
 
Database Name: Cube_database
  
 Table Name: cubesProposal

  Entries are:
  id:
  prefix:
  first_name:
  last_name:
  title:
  organization_name:
  organization_website:
  email:
  phone:

I wrote two tests for this sprint and both passed.
Thank you!
