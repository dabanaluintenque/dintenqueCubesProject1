 Project description:

You don't need any other directions beyond the basics.
This project will get data from a filled form on the wufoo website and return 
the entire data that was entered in the form. Separate line by line in the
order entered.

Here is the wufoo link:

Everything is working fine.

Sprint 2 update:
 This is the continuation of the sprint 1
for this sprint I added a database.py, and cubes_records.py files 
to create and a new database and update the previous entries in sprint 1.
Also, I updated my continuous Integration/devOps on GitHub in order to run the tests
everything is working fine except for the second test function.
